 INTRODUCTION
--------------

MATPOWER is a package of MATLAB(R) M-files for solving power flow and
optimal power flow problems. It is intended as a simulation tool for
researchers and educators that is easy to use and modify. MATPOWER
is designed to give the best performance possible while keeping the code
simple to understand and modify. It was initially developed as part
of the PowerWeb project <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/powerweb/>.

MATPOWER can be downloaded from the MATPOWER home page above.

-----------------
 GETTING STARTED
-----------------

System Requirements
-------------------
    - MATLAB(R) version 7 (R14) or later
      (available from The MathWorks, Inc. http://www.mathworks.com/), or
    - GNU Octave version 3.4 or later (free software available from
      http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

Installation
------------
1.  Follow the download instructions on the MATPOWER home page. You
    should end up with a file named matpowerXXX.zip, where XXX depends
    on the version of MATPOWER.

2.  Unzip the downloaded file. Move the resulting matpowerXXX directory
    to the location of your choice. These files should not need to be
    modified, so it is recommended that they be kept separate from your
    own code. Let <MATPOWER> denote the path to this directory.

3.  Add the following directories to your MATLAB path:
      <MATPOWER>        - core MATPOWER functions
      <MATPOWER>/t      - test scripts for MATPOWER
      <MATPOWER>/most   - core MOST functions
      <MATPOWER>/most/t - test scripts for MOST
      (optional) subdirectories of <MATPOWER>/extras -
            additional functionality and contributed code

4.  At the MATLAB prompt, type 'test_matpower' (without the quotes) to
    run the test suite and verify that MATPOWER is properly installed
    and functioning.

Running MATPOWER
----------------
To run a simple Newton power flow on the 9-bus system specified in the
file case9.m, with the default algorithm options, at the MATLAB prompt,
type:

    runpf('case9')

To load the 30-bus system data from case30.m, increase its real power
demand at bus 2 to 30 MW, then run an AC optimal power flow with
default options, type:

    define_constants;
    mpc = loadcase('case30');
    mpc.bus(2, PD) = 30;
    runopf(mpc);

By default, the results of the simulation are pretty-printed to the
screen, but the solution can also be optionally returned in a 'results'
struct. The following example shows how simple it is, after running a DC
OPF on the 118-bus system in case118.m, to access the final objective
function value, the real power output of generator 6 and the power flow
in branch 51.

    results = rundcopf('case118');
    final_objective = results.f;
    gen6_output     = results.gen(6, PG);
    branch51_flow   = results.branch(51, PF);

For additional info, see the User's Manual and the on-line help
documentation for the various MATPOWER functions. For example:
    help runpf
    help runopf
    help mpoption
    help caseformat


-----------------------------
 WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 6.0b1
-----------------------------

Below is a summary of the changes since version 5.1 of MATPOWER. See the
CHANGES file in the docs directory for all the gory details.

* New Case Files:
  - Added 9 new case files, 8 cases ranging from 1888 to 6515 buses
    representing the French system, and a 13,659-bus case representing
    parts of the of the European high voltage transmission network,
    stemming from the Pan European Grid Advanced Simulation and State
    Estimation (PEGASE) project. Thanks again to Cedric Josz and
    colleagues from the French Transmission System Operator.
  - Added case145.m, IEEE 145 bus, 50 generator dynamic test case from
    http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/dyn50/pg_tcadd50.htm.

* New Features:
  - MATPOWER Optimal Scheduling Tool (MOST) is a major new feature,
    implementing a full range of optimal power scheduling problems, from a
    simple as a deterministic, single period economic dispatch problem
    with no transmission constraints to as complex as a stochastic,
    security-constrained, combined unit-commitment and multiperiod OPF
    problem with locational contingency and load-following reserves,
    ramping costs and constraints, deferrable demands, lossy storage
    resources and uncertain renewable generation.
    See docs/MOST-manual.pdf for details.
  - General mechanism for applying modifications to an existing MATPOWER
    case. See apply_changes() and idx_ct().
  - Experimental foundation for handling of ZIP load models in power flow
    (Newton, fast-decoupled only), continuation power flow, and optimal
    power flow (MIPS, fmincon, Knitro, IPOPT solvers only). Currently,
    ZIP loads can only be specified on a system-wide basis using the
    experimental options 'exp.sys_wide_zip_loads.pw' and
    'exp.sys_wide_zip_loads.qw'.
 - Support for quadprog() under GNU Octave.
 - New contributed extras:
    - Plot electrically meaningful drawings of a MATPOWER case using
      plot_mpc() in extras/misc, contributed by Paul Cuffe.
    - Find the maximum loadability limit of a system via an optimal power
      flow and dispatchable loads, using maxloadlim() in extras/maxloadlim,
      contributed by Camille Hamon.
    - Create a quadratically-constrained quadratic programming (QCQP)
      representation of the AC power flow problem using using qcqp_opf()
      in extras/misc, contributed by Cedric Josz and colleagues.
  - New functions:
    - apply_changes() and idx_ct() provide a general mechanism for
      applying modifications to an existing MATPOWER case.
    - feval_w_path() evaluates a function located at a specified path,
      outside of the Matlab path.
    - mpopt2qpopt() provides a common interface for creating options
      struct for mi/qps_matpower() from a MATPOWER options struct.
  - New function options:
    - Option to call makeB(), makeBdc(), makePTDF(), scale_load(), and
      total_load() with full case struct (mpc) instead of individual data
      matrices (bus, branch, etc.).
    - total_load(), which now computes voltage-dependent load values,
      accepts the values 'bus' and 'area' as valid values for 'load_zone'
      argument.

* Other Improvements:
  - Changed default solver order for LP, QP, MILP, MIQP problems to move
    Gurobi before CPLEX and BPMPD after OT and GLPK.
  - Added some caching to mpoption() and made minor changes to
    nested_struct_copy() to greatly decrease the overhead added by
    mpoption() when running many small problems.
  - Added "Release History" section to Appendix of manual.
  - Many new tests.

* Bugs fixed:
  - Fixed bug in toggle_dclines() that resulted in fatal error when used
    with OPF with reactive power costs. Thanks to Irina Boiarchuk.
  - Fixed fatal bug in update_mupq() affecting cases where QMIN is greater
    than or equal to QC1MIN and QC2MIN (or QMAX is less than or equal to
    QC1MAX and QC2MAX) for all generators. Thanks Jose Miguel.
  - Copying a field containing a struct to a non-struct field with
    nested_struct_copy() now overwrites rather than causing a fatal error.
  - Fixed a bug in psse_convert_xfmr() where conversion of data for
    transformers with CZ=3 was done incorrectly. Thanks to Jose Marin
    and Yujia Zhu.
  - Fixed a fatal bug in psse_convert_xfmr() affecting transformers with
    CW and/or CZ equal to 1. Thanks to Matthias Resch.
  - Fixed a crash in have_fcn() caused by changes in OPTI Toolbox v2.15
    (or possibly v2.12)
  - Commented out isolated bus 10287 in case3375wp.m.
  - Added code to DC OPF to return success = 0 for cases where the matrix
    is singular (e.g. islanded system without slack).
  - Fixed problem in have_fcn() where SeDuMi was turning off and leaving
    off all warnings.

* Incompatible Change:
  - Removed fairmax() from the public interface by moving it inside uopf(),
    the only place it was used.

 DOCUMENTATION
---------------

There are four primary sources of documentation for MATPOWER.
    - MATPOWER User's Manual
    - MOST User's Manual
    - MATPOWER Online Function Reference
      (http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/docs/ref)
    - MATLAB's 'help' command

The MATPOWER and MOST User's Manuals are included in the distribution
(docs/MATPOWER-manual.pdf and docs/MOST-manual.pdf) or they can be downloaded
separately from http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/MATPOWER-manual.pdf and
http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/MOST-manual.pdf. Previous
versions are available at http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/docs/.

Each M-file has its own documentation which can be accessed by typing at
the MATLAB prompt:

    help <name of M-file>

Documentation for the case data file format can be found by typing:

    help caseformat

If something is still unclear after checking the manual and the help,
the source code *is* the documentation. ;-)

These packages are distributed separately since each has it's own
license agreement and terms of use.

Note: For Windows users, one of the best ways to get access to some high
performance solvers, without dealing with the pain of building the MEX
interfaces yourself, is to install the OPTI Toolbox by Jonathan Currie,
available at: http://www.i2c2.aut.ac.nz/Wiki/OPTI/. The installation is
simple and it includes pre-built MEX files for several of the above
solvers, including CLP, GLPK and IPOPT.
